= Introduction

This project aims to simplify the process of running SQL queries using https://flink.apache.org/[Apache Flink] on Kubernetes.
Currently, in order to run SQL queries with Flink, you would need to run the Flink SQL client CLI or submit queries via a REST request to a Flink SQL Gateway instance.

This project provides a convenient wrapper application and container image for use with the https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/[Flink Kubernetes Operator's] `+FlinkDeployment+` custom resource, allowing you to specify your SQL queries as arguments.
